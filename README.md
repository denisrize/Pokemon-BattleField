# Pokemon Battle Game

This Console App was build as a part of my Advanced Programming University Course with C programming langauge. 
To run the program use the MakeFile from the Terminal and Write the following : ./PokemonBattles 4(number of types ),10(capacity of the numer of types),FullRun_Data.txt(path to Configuration of the Pokemon file).

The project is focusing about:
- functional programming.
- Memory management :  
  - Dynamic memory allocation and deletion. 
  -  Handeling memory leaks using Valgrind.
- High level use of Pointers.
- Use of Generic ADT and various complex Data Structures ( maxHeap,LinkedList etc).
- Compilation and linking processes.
- Space/Time complexity.

This Console App was build as a part of my Advanced Programming University Course with C programming langauge. 
The project is foucsing about the following points:
- functional programming.
- Memory management :  
  - Dynamic memory allocation and deletion. 
  -  Handeling memory leaks using Valgrind.
- High level use of Pointers.
- Use of Generic ADT and various complex Data Structures ( maxHeap,LinkedList etc).
- Compiler and Space-Time complexity.
